## Creating user and assigning them to groups with IAM policies through AWS Management Console

Managing a workstation by assigning the people their roles and identities is a very efficient way of dealing with the workload and same goes with IAM in AWS.
Through IAM we can easily create users for AWS who can work on the workloads by from their own IAM account also the users that are working in a same team or project can be grouped together with some set of policies that they will be working with.

So first it starts with creating an User in AWS through IAM, lets see how to accomplish the task-

## Step:1
To create a new User for AWS navigate to your root user account and then hit IAM inside the search bar on the AWS MANGEMENT CONSOLE
## Step:2
Now fill the details as per your requirement
## Step:3
Add the user to a group which has administrator access IAM policy attached to the group
## Step:4
Add a tag for the user you are creating
## Step:5
Review your setting and then hit create user

Now navigate to the users tab in the IAM console you can find the new created user which is attached to the group and with IAM policies attached to it
The details of the user that was created can be seen by clicking the user that we just created and we can find the details of that user
